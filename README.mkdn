LineageOS++
===========

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOSPlusPlus/manifests.git -b lospp-19.1
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
and use our script
```
./build.sh
```
